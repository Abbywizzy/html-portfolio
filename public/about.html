<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a self taught web developer. I realised I loved it when I created new things, so I took the decision to go into coding and explore things.</p>

<p>My learning period was not rosy. I had a lot of downtimes and moments when I almost gave up. Coding came with its own challenges but with dedication and perseverance I made it.</p>

<p>I am glad I made this hard decision a long time ago and I hope that the future ahead of me is brighter and better. I am hoping to explore the coding world of opportunities and also take on simple to difficult tasks as the day goes by.</p>
